The project took about 6 hours to complete. It took some time to get up and running in the beginning because I was unsure if my models were configured properly due to the lack of lighting. Once I got the lighting in place, things started to click and I was able to understand how to get the scene built. The globe animation alone took some time and I had to review the animation videos a few times to get it to work.
